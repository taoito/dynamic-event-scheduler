Dynamic Event Scheduler repository
----------------------------

A planner and reminder system that is aware of and responds dynamically to the user's current location and time of day.

The system includes two primary components: the Mobile Client App and the Backend Cloud service. The app is responsible for all interactions with the user, and will run on a Windows Phone. User interactions include reminder displays and the entering of new appointments into the system. The cloud service holds the user's data and sends that data to the mobile device on request.
